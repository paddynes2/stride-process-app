# Improvements — Stride

## High Priority
<!-- Agent-discovered UX/polish wins that are noticeable -->

- [ ] #IMP-001 Add color format validation to perspective API — Attempts: 0
  - **Found:** Iteration 57 (quality audit)
  - **Category:** Input validation
  - **Where:** `src/app/api/v1/perspectives/route.ts` POST, `src/app/api/v1/perspectives/[id]/route.ts` PATCH
  - **What:** `color` field accepts any string (could be "not-a-color"). Should validate hex format.
  - **Why it matters:** Invalid colors would break UI rendering of perspective indicators.
  - **Suggested fix:** Add regex validation `if (color && !/^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$/i.test(color)) return errorResponse("validation", "Invalid color format", 400);`

- [ ] #IMP-002 Color picker keyboard accessibility + ARIA in perspective settings — Attempts: 0
  - **Found:** Iteration 57 (quality audit)
  - **Category:** Accessibility
  - **Where:** `src/app/(app)/w/[workspaceId]/settings/page.tsx` — PerspectiveRow color picker
  - **What:** Color picker popup opens/closes on click only. Missing `role="listbox"`, `aria-expanded`, arrow key navigation. Screen readers can't announce the picker as a dropdown.
  - **Why it matters:** WCAG 2.1 Level A: keyboard operability + proper ARIA.
  - **Design principle:** Nielsen's heuristic #7 (Flexibility and efficiency of use)

## Medium Priority
<!-- Improvements that would help but aren't urgent -->

- [ ] #IMP-003 Annotation indicator dots lack semantic ARIA for screen readers — Attempts: 0
  - **Found:** Iteration 57 (quality audit)
  - **Category:** Accessibility
  - **Where:** `src/components/canvas/step-node.tsx`, `section-node.tsx`, `touchpoint-node.tsx`, `stage-node.tsx`
  - **What:** Annotation indicator dots have `title` attribute but no `aria-label` or `role="status"`. Screen readers won't announce them meaningfully.
  - **Why it matters:** Perspective annotations are invisible to assistive tech users.
  - **Suggested fix:** Add `aria-label="Annotated by perspective"` and `role="img"` to indicator divs.

- [ ] #IMP-004 Optimize annotation loading for large canvases — Attempts: 0
  - **Found:** Iteration 57 (quality audit)
  - **Category:** Performance
  - **Where:** `src/app/(app)/w/[workspaceId]/[tabId]/canvas-view.tsx` refreshAnnotatedIds()
  - **What:** Currently fetches ALL annotations for the active perspective (across all tabs/elements). On a perspective with 100+ annotations, this is wasteful. The fetchAnnotations API already supports filtering by type/id but the canvas doesn't use it.
  - **Why it matters:** Performance degradation as annotation count grows.
  - **Suggested fix:** Filter by tab's element IDs or paginate. Alternatively, accept current approach until real users report slowness.

## Low Priority
<!-- Nice-to-have polish items -->

- [ ] #IMP-005 Orphaned annotations when entities deleted (no FK on annotatable_id) — Attempts: 0
  - **Found:** Iteration 57 (quality audit)
  - **Category:** Data integrity
  - **Where:** `supabase/migrations/012_perspectives.sql` — `perspective_annotations.annotatable_id` has no foreign key constraint
  - **What:** When a step/section/touchpoint/stage is deleted, its annotations are NOT cascade-deleted. They remain in the DB orphaned (referencing non-existent entity IDs). The UI won't show them (fetch returns them but they don't match any canvas elements), but they bloat the table.
  - **Why it matters:** Data hygiene. Not urgent because orphaned records don't break anything, but accumulate over time.
  - **Suggested fix:** Add a DB trigger or periodic cleanup. FK constraints are complex here due to polymorphic annotatable_type pointing to different tables.
